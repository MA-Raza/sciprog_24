## Introduction:  
This directory contains the code files for Practical 08. 

* The C code contained in the file `GDC.c` takes two positive integers as inputs and returns the Greatest Common Denominator (GDC) of the two integers using both an iterative and recursive approach.  

## Compiling:  

To compile `GDC.c` execute: 
 
```bash
gcc -o GDC GDC.c
```

## Running:  

Run the compiled `GDC.c` using:  

```bash
./GDC
```

The output should be:  

```bash
Please enter two positive integers:
35 95
IterativeGDC(35, 95) = 5
RecursiveGDC(35, 95) = 5
```
